**Project Report: Uber Ride Analysis**
1. Dataset Description

Source: The dataset uberdrive.csv contains real ride details from Uber trips.

Features:

START_DATE*, END_DATE*: Start and end time of each ride.

CATEGORY*: Type of ride (Business/Personal).

MILES*: Distance traveled.

PURPOSE*: Purpose of ride (Meeting, Meal, etc.).

START*, STOP*: Pickup and drop-off locations.

Preprocessing Steps:

Handled missing values in PURPOSE* by replacing with "NOT".

Converted START_DATE* and END_DATE* into proper datetime formats.

Extracted new columns like:

date (ride date),

time (hour of the day),

day-night (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night),

MONTH, WEEKDAY, and ROUND_TRIP.

Removed duplicates for clean analysis.

Standardized column names (removed *, converted to lowercase).

2. Key Insights from Data Analysis

Ride Demand Patterns:

Most rides occur during mornings and evenings, showing commuting behavior.

Higher frequency of rides during weekdays compared to weekends.

Monthly trend: Some months (like summer) have more ride activity.

Peak Hours:

Peak demand lies between 7 AM – 10 AM and 5 PM – 8 PM, aligning with office travel times.

Pricing & Distance Trends:

Boxplot and violin plots show that Business rides often cover longer distances compared to Personal rides.

Certain purposes like “Meetings” or “Meal/Entertainment” result in more mileage.

Round Trips:

A notable number of rides start and end at the same location (e.g., airport runs, office loops).

Top Locations:

Certain cities appear frequently as top pickup/drop-off points, highlighting popular commute areas.

Average Statistics:

Average miles vary across different times of the day; mornings show slightly longer average rides.

Business rides tend to have longer durations than personal rides.

3. Applied Machine Learning Models

Note: The current code focuses mainly on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization. No machine learning model has been applied yet.

Future Scope for ML Models:

Demand Forecasting: Time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM) can be used to predict ride demand per hour/day.

Pricing Prediction: Regression models can predict fare (if fare data is available) using features like distance, time, and purpose.

Customer Segmentation: Clustering (K-means) can identify groups of users based on travel purpose and timing.
